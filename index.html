            Long have I been impressed at the ability of words to illuminate realities in the minds of those who hear them. It was this which inspired me to earn a Masters of Journalism after I graduated my Bachelor of Biotechnology. Eager to share the lessons of science in a narrative comprehensible to the general public, I spent several years in my career as a technology journalist.

            Living in Mexico, I took time off work to raise my three children to be the intelligent, compassionate, friendly and motivated people they show every sign of becoming. At the same time I started a bio-ethical student housing project with my wife.

            Returning to Australia, my attention turned to an area where words have the most direct and predictable effect on the the world illuminated: Web development. I aim to use my coding skills to share knowledge and services in a simple, appealing and engaging manner.
