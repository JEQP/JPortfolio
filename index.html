                    Long have I been impressed at the ability of words to illuminate realities in the minds of those who
                    hear them. It was this which inspired me to earn a Masters of Journalism after I graduated my
                    Bachelor of Biotechnology. Eager to share the lessons of science in a narrative comprehensible to
                    the general public, I spent several years in my career as a technology journalist.

                    Living in Mexico, I took time off work to raise my three children to be the intelligent,
                    compassionate, friendly and motivated people they show every sign of becoming. At the same time I
                    started a bio-ethical student housing project with my wife.

                    Returning to Australia, my attention turned to an area where words have the most direct and
                    predictable effect on the the world illuminated: Web development. I aim to use my coding skills to
                    share knowledge and services in a simple, appealing and engaging manner.
